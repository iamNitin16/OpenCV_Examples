# Contributors Guideline

If you want contribute to this repository, then please read these *guidelines carefully*.

## Want to add a new Example

If you want to add new example then follow these steps:-

-	First you need to clone this repository using the `git clone command`
```git
git clone https://github.com/iamNitin16/OpenCV_Examples.git
```
-	Then create a seperate branch with a `branch-name` that suits your example that you are going to add and implement, and checkout that branch. You can do it in two ways:-
	-	You can create and checkout the newly created branch using a single command:-

```git
git checkout -b branch-name
```
	-	Or, you can create a branch first and then switch using the following command
	
```git
git branch branch-name
git checkout branch-name
```

-	After creating branch, create a seperate repository for your *OpenCV Example* and inside your `example-directory` create `src` folder and put all your **C/C++** code out there. Commit your changes and create a *pull-request*. Then we will review your code and if it looks good to us then we will merge it to our repository.
***Note:- Please add README.md to your `example-directory` along with the build and run instructions.***
